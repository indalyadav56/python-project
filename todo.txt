ere are some common Python interview questions for senior developers, covering a range of topics:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Explain inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in detail, providing Python-specific examples.
Describe the use cases for class methods, static methods, and instance methods.
Implement the singleton pattern in Python, discussing its pros and cons.
Compare and contrast decorators and subclassing, providing examples of when each is appropriate.
Explain the concept of metaclasses and how they can be used to customize class creation.
Memory Management:

Describe Python's memory management mechanisms, including reference counting, garbage collection, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

How do you handle circular references in Python?
What are weak references and how are they used?
Optimize memory usage for large datasets in Python.
Data Structures and Algorithms:

Implement a Python function to check if a binary tree is balanced.
